# GoProject
 My first Go project that demonstrates loose coupling techniques to store and provide user information from database.

# Goal in mind

Adaptability to change: Organizing code in a modular and flexible way so that I can introduce new features, refactor existing code and respond to evolving business requirements.

Focus on business value: Clear on focus on business value and client expectations.
